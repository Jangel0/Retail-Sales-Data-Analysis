# Retail Sales Data Analysis
Data analysis performed on a retail sales dataset, focusing on different variables. Using Python, data was transformed before using Power BI to create a dashboard to show the analysis results and sales behavior throughout the year. A linear regression model was used for predicting sales. Additionally, a version of the project was made in Excel.
